dropzone.js
===========

dropzone.js is an open source library that provides drag'n'drop file uploads by simply including a java-script file. It views previews of images and you can register to different events to control how and which files are uploaded.

<div id="dropzone"><form action="http://www.torrentplease.com/dropzone.php" class="dropzone">
</form></div>


installation
------------

The easiest and recommended way to install dropzone is through [ender](http://ender.no.de/)

    $ ender build dropzone

If you don't use ender (shame on you) you can [download a bundle here](https://github.com/enyo/dropzonejs).
